// Abstraction -----------------------------------------------------------

// abstraction: the process of considering something independently of its associations,
// attributes, or concrete accompaniments

// !! software solutions should be decomposable into their component parts, and
// recomposable into new solutions, without changing the internal component
// implementation details

// Abstraction is the act of simplification -----------------------------

// The process of abstraction has two main components:

// Generalization: the process of finding similarities (the obvious) in repeated patterns, and
// and hiding similarities behind an abstraction

// Specialization: the process of using the abstraction, supplying only what is different
// (the meaningful) for each use case

// Abstraction is the process of extracting the underlying essence of a concept.

// By exploring common ground between different problems from different domains, we learn how to
// step outside our headspace for a moment and see a problem from a different perspective.

// Abstraction in software --------------------------------------

// abstraction in software takes many forms:
//  - algorithms
//  - data structures
//  - modules
//  - classes
//  - frameworks
//  - and functions

// Functions make great abstractions because they posses the qualities that are
// essential for good abstraction:

// Identity - ability to assign a name to it and reuse it in different contexts

// Composition - The ability to compose simple functions to form more complex functions

// Abstraction through composition --------------------------------------

// pure functions are the most useful for abstraction
